I was able to code a solution which allowed one player to play this game. The player makes a choice, and the computer compares it to a randomly generated choice of its own, then displays the result.

# Future Enhancements

* Make website fully responsive
* Add Two player mode with sessions
* More testing
* Track scores

# Getting Started

The app has been deployed to (heroku)[http://rockypaperyskissors.herokuapp.com]

However if you would prefer to run it locally, clone the repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/robertpulson/rps-challenge.git`

Then `cd rps-challenge`, and `bundle install` to install the required gems.

Use `rackup` and navigate to `localhost:9292` and prepare yourself for some madness.

The lower you fall, the higher you'll fly...
